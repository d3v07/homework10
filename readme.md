## Summary
- I gained practical experience in software version control by managing a Git repository, effectively using pull requests (PRs) to track changes and ensure code quality before merging into the main branch. I also deepened my understanding of RESTful API integration for seamless communication between services. This process enhanced automated CI/CD pipelines, where successful builds trigger unit tests and subsequently deploy containerized applications to DockerHub, streamlining deployment and scaling in real-world applications.
